What are the differences between malloc and new ?

Both are used to allocate dynamic memory allocation

1)malloc is a function ->allocates memory from heap ->return void*

while new is an operator, calls datatype constructor -> allocates memory from free store 
return fully typed pointer

2)To remove the allocated mmeory, for malloc we use free, which is again a function 
while delete calls destrcutor and releases memory.

3)On failure,malloc returns NULL while new throws exception .

====================
Heap-: dynamic memory area which is allocated/freed by malloc/free
Free store-: dynamic memory area which is allocated/freed by new/delete
